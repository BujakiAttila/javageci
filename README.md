Java Generate Code Inline

Javageci is a framework to generate Java code. Code generation programs implemented using Javageci can be executed
to generate new source code, modify existing Java source files. This way the programmer can use meta programming to
express code in a shorter and more expressive way than it would be possible in pure Java.

The framework discovers the files that need generated code, provides easy to use API to generate code and
takes care to write the generated code into the source code. The code generating code should focus on the
actual code structure it wants to generate.

Although many times the need for code generation is a code smell, and is considered to be a bad programming practice
there are valid scenarios where the application of javageci may be okay. These include the followings:

* You could use run-time meta programming (a.k.a. reflection), but the required performance of the application
  does not permit the overhead of reflection during run-time. It may also be the case that the debugging of
  the reflective utility classes are too complex, but on the other hand the code generated by javageci is
  there and is easy to understand and debug.

* You have to use some old version of Java that does not allow advanced functionality and you want to avoid a lot of
  boilerplate code.
