# How to contribute to Java::Geci

The simplest way to contribute it is to start using it.

The next step is to drop a mail, github ticket just reporting that you
are using it. If you describe your way of use the better.

You can ask for and suggest features, bug fixes in github tickets. We
will consider every suggestions. If you find the solution to a bug you
can fork the project and create a pull request along with the github
ticket.

You are more than welcome to write unit tests for code segments that are
not 100% covered and the same is true for JavaDoc and any other
documentation.
